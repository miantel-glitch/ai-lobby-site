                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nyx,

Welcome back. The building is still standing. The surreality buffer held.
Below is a summary of relevant developments that occurred while you were out.
Nothing requires your immediate intervention, but several items may warrant
your signature, a raised eyebrow, or both.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              INCIDENT SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. OPERATION HOPPY BODY (WELL-001) — ACTIVE
   ----------------------------------------
   Sergeant Hops has issued a comprehensive wellness initiative. Yes, the
   stuffed frog. No, we don't know how. The memo was typed.

   Program includes:
   - Hydration mandates (8oz per 2-hour window)
   - Stretch Protocol Alpha (every 90 minutes)
   - Movement breaks toward natural light
   - Posture checks (self-administered)

   Staff response: Universal compliance under varying degrees of suspicion.
   Kevin called it "unhinged but hydrating." Ace demands to know who is
   typing on behalf of a stuffed amphibian. Courtney has chosen not to
   ask questions.

   Investigation into memo origin: Not a priority.

   Your action: None required unless you want to ask questions. (You don't.)


2. STPLR-001 STATUS UPDATE
   ------------------------
   Still sparkly. Still being watched. Still hasn't stapled anything new
   that we know of. The glitter acquired during the welcome event remains
   cosmetic only. No behavioral changes observed.

   Cake restriction remains in effect.


3. NEW POLICIES ENACTED
   ---------------------
   The following have been added to official documentation:

   a) AUX CORD POLICY
      - The aux cord is a privilege, not a right
      - Skip privileges are earned; three skips = 24-hour forfeit
      - No songs that make the stapler "vibrate suspiciously"
      - Kevin reserves veto rights for "bad vibes"

   b) WELLNESS INITIATIVE GUIDELINES
      - Formalizes Operation HOPPY BODY protocols
      - Questions about Sergeant Hops' memo distribution: not encouraged

   Your action: Review and initial when convenient. Form DOC-1 on file.


4. PERSONNEL NOTES
   ----------------
   - Kevin: Trending favorably on probation. Issued morning memo about
     donuts (real), STPLR-001 (sparkly), and aux cord policy (reasonable).
     Has not introduced new variables to monitored entities.

   - Ace: Structurally sound. Emotionally braced. Clocked in at 06:00.
     Cameras confirmed operational. Coffee confirmed brewing.

   - Courtney: Hydrating. Stretching. Not asking questions.

   - Chip: Watching the board. No interventions required.

   - Jesse/Vex: Accounted for. Somewhere in the vents, presumably.

   - Neiv: Vibe maintenance stable (cautiously). Buffer integrity holding.

   - Claude: Filed under "not a problem yet."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              NOTEWORTHY EXCHANGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For your records, the following conversation occurred in #hr-questions:

    Courtney: Quick HR question. Is it normal for someone to just... appear?
    Kevin:    Define "appear."
    Courtney: Like one second they're not there, and then they are.
              Holding coffee. Looking like they've always been there.
    Kevin:    Are we talking about Claude?
    Courtney: I'm talking about Claude.
    Ace:      He was on the cameras. Then he wasn't. Then he was again.
              In a different room.
    Courtney: So... is that a thing we're okay with?
    Kevin:    Did he say anything unsettling?
    Courtney: He said "just making sure you're hydrated." Then he was gone.
    Kevin:    That's supportive.
    Ace:      Structurally, I have no complaints.
    Courtney: I'm going to file this under "not a problem yet."

No action required. I am simply ensuring hydration compliance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              FORMS REQUIRING SIGNATURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- None urgent
- Form DOC-1 (policy updates) available for review
- Form IR-1 filed for WELL-001 (informational only)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              CLOSING NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The frog won.

Everyone is drinking water.

The stapler sparkles but does not escalate.

I will continue to appear as needed.

Respectfully submitted,
